## Design & implementation


**Bookmark Component**

This bookmark section consists of how the bookmark feature is implemented. 
The bookmark feature is implemented similarly as the main architecture, however, 
in a smaller scale and a more bookmark-specific way. Figure 1 illustrates the general overview, 
the associations and the multiplicity of the bookmark classes.

API: java.bookmarkRun

The bookmark component consists of six major classes: `BookmarkRun`, `BookmarkStorage`, `BookmarkUi`, 
`BookmarkCategory`, `BookmarkList` and `BookmarkParser`. 
As shown in figure 1, `BookmarkRun` is 
* The main class to be called when the bookmark mode is accessed.
* The main class to access other bookmark classes.

Given below, Figure 2, is the sequence diagram of how the classes interact with each 
other when bookmark mode is accessed from the main function.

The bookmark component has two modes: the main bookmark mode and the category mode. 
As shown in Figure 2, when `BookmarkRun` is called, 
`BookmarkParser` will be called and return a `BookmarkCommand`. 
Afterwards, `BookmarkRun` will then call `executeCommand` in `BookmarkCommand` which executes 
the intended actions 
Then, it will call `getCategorymode` to get the current mode the user is in. 

**Bookmark Implementation**

A more detailed explanation of `BookmarkCommand`, `BookmarkCategory` and `BookmarkList` will be 
shown below. `BookmarkUi` and `BookmarkStorage` follow the same design implementations as the main 
architecture. The below figure shows the command classes available and they are called based on the 
`BookmarkParser` class as illustrated in Figure 2.

Figure 4 shows a more detailed sequence diagram of how the `BookmarkCategory`, `BookmarkCommand` 
and `BookmarkList` interacts with each other for the scenario when the user input an `AddLinkCommand` 
in Bookmark mode.
