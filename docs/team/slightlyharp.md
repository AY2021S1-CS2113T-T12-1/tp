##Project: Study it

Study It is an interactive desktop app that helps students manage their study related matters, 
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). 


Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature:** Implemented the timetable mode

  * **Sub feature:** Added add class and add activity command that allow user to 
  add events to the schedule.
  
  * **Sub feature:** Added show schedule command to display the full schedule
  the user has planned for the next seven days
  
  * **Sub feature:** Added show link command to allow user to see the 
  link user need for the next two hours.
    * Justification: This feature allows user to experience the ease of 
    access links he/she need for events during the COVID period when many
    links needed to be managed for school and work
    
  * **Sub feature:** Added show activity command to allow user to see the
  full list of activities the user has added.
