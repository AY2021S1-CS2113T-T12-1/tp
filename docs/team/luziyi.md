## Project: Study it

Study It is an interactive desktop app that helps students manage their study related matters, 
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). 
Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Features added: 

* Implemented the bulk of the academic mode.
  * What it does: allows user to manage two lists, one being a grade book, and the other being an address book.
  * Justification: being a personal student assistant to students, the academic mode is crucial to students
  as it allows them to track their performances, as well a list of important contacts of professors and tutors.
